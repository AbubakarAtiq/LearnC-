    Object Oriented Programming in C++
    ----------------------------------
    it is approach,method from your ideas, helps
    you to bug free it.
    -Why oops?
    1. C++ language was designed with the main intention 
    of adding object-oriented features to C language.
    2. As the size of the program increases, readability, maintainability and
    bug-free nature of programs decreases.
    3. This was the major problem with languages like C which relied upon
    functions or procedures (hence the name procedural programming language)
    4. As a result, the possibility of not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high.
    5. Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
    6. Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    -Procedure oriented programming
    1. Consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow.
    2. Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data.
        main()
        {
            f();
            f1();#this is the example
        }
    3. Functions can either use local or global data.
    4. Data moves openly from function to function.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    -Object oriented programming
    1. Works on the concept of classes and objects.
    2. A class is a template to create objects.
    3. Treats data as a critical element.
    4. Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around
    the objects.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    -Basic concepts in object oriented programming
    1. Classes -Basic template for creating objects.
    2. Objects - Basic run time entities.
    3. Data Abstraction and Encapsulation - Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
    4. Inheritance - Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
    5. Polymorphism - ability to take more than one forms.
    6. Dynamic Binding -code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
    7. Message passing - Object.message(Information) call format.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    -Benefits of object oriented programming
    1. Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
    2. Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
    3. Multiple objects can co-exit without any interference.
    4. Software complexity can be easily managed.
