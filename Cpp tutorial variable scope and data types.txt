1. A variable is a container to hold data.
2. variable can be of various types. Primarily we have these variable
    types in C++:
    1. int
    2. float
    3. char
    4. double
    5. boolean
    ->int sum=34; means sum is an integer variable which holds value 34
    in memory.
    -->Syntax for declaring variables in C++
        1. Data_typeVariable_name=value;
        2. Ex.Int a=4, b=6;
        3. Based on scope, variable can be classified into two types:
            1. local variables.
            2. Global variables.
    -->variable scope
        1. scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of
            variable is valid.
        2. Based on scope we have local and Global variable in C++.
        3. Local variables: Local variables are declared inside the braces
            of any function and can be accessed only from there.
        4. Global variables: Global variables are declared outside any function
            and can be accessed from anywhere.
        5. Can Global local variable have same name in C++?: Yes, we will see!
    -->C++ Data types
        1. Data types define the type of data a variable can hold, for 
            example an integer variable can hold integer data, a character type variable can hold character data etc.
        2. Data types in C++ are categorised in three groups:
            1. Built-in.
            2. User-defined.
            3. Derived.
--> Built in Data types in c++
    1. Int----------->0,1,2,3,4...
    2. float---------->1.22,1.33, decimal numbers of low precision.
    3. char----------->'y',etc
    4. double--------->3.8878898, decimal numbers of High precision.
    5. bool-----------> True, false.
-->User defined data types in C++
    1. Struct
    2. Union
    3. Enum
    Note: These will be covered separately in different videos. For 
    now understanding that these are the user defined data types should do!.
-->Derived data types in C++
    1. Array
    2. function
    3. Pointer
    Note: These will be covered separately in different videos. For
    now understanding that these are the Derived defined data types 
    should do!
-->Rules to declare variables in C++
    1. variable names in C++ can range from 1 to 255 characters.
    2. All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore(_).
    3. After the first initial letter, variable names can also contain
        letters and numbers.
    4. variable names are case sensitive.
    5. No spaces or special characters are allowed.
    6. You cannot use a C++ keyword (a reserved word) as a variable name.
