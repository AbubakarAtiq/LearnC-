 * This website is used to learn this topic, I also recommended it.
 * In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
 * To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier), For example,

     * here, age is a variable of the int data type, and we have assigned an integer value 14 to it.
     * Note:
     * The int data type suggests that the variable can only hold integers.
     * Similarly, we can use the double data type if we have to store decimals and exponential.
     * We will learn about all the data types in detail in the next tutorial.
     * The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.

    =====Rules for naming a variable====
        1.A variable name can only have alphabets, numbers, and the underscore__.
        2.A variable name cannot begin with a number.
        3.It is a preferred practice to begin variable names with a lowercase character.For example, name is preferable to Name.
        4.A variable name cannot be a keyword. For example, int is a keyword that is used to denote integers.
        5.A variable name can start with an underscore. However, it is not considered a good practice.
        Note:
            We should try to give meaningful names to variables. For example, first_name is a better variable name than fn.
