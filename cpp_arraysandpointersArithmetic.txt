    C++ tutorial:Arrays
-->What are arrays in C++?
1.An array is a collection of items of similar type stored in
contiguous memory locations.
2.Sometimes,a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data.
3.For example, lets say we want to store the marks of 2500 students,
having 2500 different variables for this task is not feasible.
4.To solve this problem,we can define an array with size 2500 that
can hold the marks of all students.
for example,
int marks[2500];//int array which will store data
-->C++ pointers and arrays
    continuous blocl of memory is called as array.
-->pointer arithmetic:
address_new=address_new+i*sizeof(data type)
(p+i)=p+i*sizeof(data_type)
e.g, 32+1*4=36
