-->Basic Input/Output in C++
1. C++ comes with libraries which helps us in performing input/output. In c++ sequence of bytes corresponding to input and output are commonly knowns as streams.
2.Input stream: Direction of flow of bytes takes place from input device(for example keyboard) to the main memory.
3. Output stream: Direction of flow of bytes takes place from main memory to the output device (for example Display)
-->List of reserved keyboards in C++
1. This is a list of keyboards reserved in C++.
2. Since they are used by the language itself,these keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading.
3. In short, you cannot create a variable with these names.
    -->These are the following list:
    1.alignas(since c++11)  2.alignof(since c++11)  3.and
    4.and_eq    5.asm   6.atomic_cancel(TM TS)
    7.atomic_commit(TM TS)  8.atomic_noexcept(TM TS)    9.auto(1)
    10.bitand 11.bitor  12.bool     13.break    14.case     15.catch so on
